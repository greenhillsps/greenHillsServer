now its avalible it localy we upload this usng hithub first we create accound in githum.com its free and then create new directry
ofter copy link this directory and then.

1) git remote add origin https://github.com/muqair/test.git     //connected to your githum space
 =>git remote set-url origin https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git   // for reset url

2)git push origin master   //push your project


now if we want to access this project it any computer for this 

1) git clone https://github.com/muqair/test.git  //your cloning url first time

when you you want to update any change then 

2) git pull origin master //for check update if any change found its clone these changis

3) git remote show origin


 now lats go to understand branches.
branches basically used to make copy of project its mean we make many of many branches and difernet users
work on it but original project structure stal not to be change.
and after then we marge all these branches in original project or root .

1) git branch  //chech how many branches

2) git branch new_test  //for crate new branch its time crate a copy from root branch

3) git checkout new_test //for switch from one branch to other

if we marge the child branch to root project for that first we select root branch that is by default master
so

1) git checkout master //switch to root folder

2) git marge new_test  //marge new_test folder to over main master folder.

for deleting root directory

1) git branch -d new_test  //for deleting branch
